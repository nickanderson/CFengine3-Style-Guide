A proposed style guide for CFengine3. 

Currently only encompases syntax style, but I would like to extend to 
reccomended file orginization design patterns.

Using Sphinx Documentation builder. Source directory contains the
documentation.

Building the documentation::

    pip install sphinx
    make html

.. note::
    epub and latex output is also available, pdf or ps output can be generated from
    latex output.
